                                                               Introduction: 

This project aims to classify the input image as either a dog or a cat image. The image input which you give to the system will be analyzed and the predicted result will be given as output. Machine learning algorithm [Convolutional Neural Networks] is used to classify the image. 
The model thus implemented can be extended to a mobile device or any website as per the developerâ€™s need.
